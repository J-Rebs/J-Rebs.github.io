## About Me

  Hey! I'm Joe. I used to work as an international tax consultant, and now I'm a 
  current computer science masterâ€™s student at Columbia University. My prior work dealt with a lot of Excel and financial reporting data, 
  which got me interested in how computer science could help make my job more efficient. After doing some work around
  VBA automation, I decided to go back to school to improve my formal computer science training. Studying computer science,
  I have grown curious how business and society can bridge the gap between things like databases and machine learning and 
  people working in other areas who could benefit from such tools but who might be hesistant to give them a try. 

  Outside of computer science, you can probably find me trying every single coffee shop in New York, trying to pick up a bit of a new language
  here or there, and learning how to be a better cook and baker..
